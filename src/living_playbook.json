Ask them to respond to questions as they keep the rhyme running in their heads. They should have problems responding to the questions. Next, have them play their neutral scene again, this time with a \"I love you\" or \"I hate you\" mantra. The key to the mantra scene is to play the mantra truthfully within the context of the scene. If your mantra is \"I love you\", you should show your love in actions and what you say, you should always TRY to say \"I love you\" in everything you say, but only say \"I love you\" if you can do it truthfully in the context of the scene. Some basic mantras are; \"I love you\", \"I hate you\", \"I want to sleep with you\", \" I want nothing\", \"I'm better than you.\", etc. The list of possibilities is endless. After some time, you may want to work with more complex mantras, such as \"I love you, but I want you to go\", \"I hate you, but I want to sleep with you\", etc. Again the possibilities are endless.
